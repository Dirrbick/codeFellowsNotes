## Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
  * It allows us to be able to be able to work locally and not have to worry about internet access. All of the browsers have their own things that are acceptable and if you run code outside of the browser you can be more consistent on what you are looking for.
## What is the difference between a module and a package?
  * Module:
    * A place where you write small snippets of code that you can call later in other JS files. It does not run until it is called in the other file/chunk of code.
  * Packages:
    * Extensions of modules, they are the power house of Node.js ecosystem. We can use them to create complex code that serves a certain purpose and also publish them for others to see and use.
## What is one benefit of Test Driven Development?
  * The benefit is that you can see what is wrong with your code and write a test to see a specific result. If it fails you can figure it out easier.
## What is one potential downside of Test Driven Development?
  * If you set it up to run automatically it is "testing" the site that is live. So with that you are essentially not testing it before it goes to development.
## What does the node package manager do?
  * **N**ode **P**ackage **M**anager: **NPM**
    * It allows us to utilize any *packages* that are created by other developers. So I were to create a package it you could use it with NPM.

# Vocabulary
  * ecosystem:
  * Node.js: a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside of the browser
  * V8 Engine: Googles high perfomenat open-source program that runs JavaScript code
  * module: collection of functions or JavaScript code that is defined in a single environment
  * package: contains modules that are made to be shared with other developers
  * node package manager (npm): allows us to install packages from external developers and maintain package versions and updates
  * Test Driven Development (TDD): Builds tests to fail, encourages well planned coding
  * Jest: testing framework that makes it very simple for developers to write and run unit test for code
  * Continuous Integration (CI): dev practice where all code challenges go through an automatic process 
  * unit test: modular test that covers one unit of code in an application
