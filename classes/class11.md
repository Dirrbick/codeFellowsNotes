1. Come up with an application scenario where you would want to use a stack.
  - A real life scenario is if you were to have an option for the client to "undo" their selection. In a sense, they were editing a picture and needed to undo a line that got erased
2. Come up with an application scenario where you would want to use a queue.
  - A scenario would be with the hospital, when you have patients walk-in they are put into a queue. The first one that signed in is the first one to be seen by the doctor.
3. Why are pop, push, enqueue and dequeue always O(1)?
  - No matter how many items that are in a stack, it takes the same amount of time to add/remove Nodes with each method.
