# Questions
## Why would a developer choose to make data models?
  * Many reasons, first it allows you to be able to plan easily and set up exactly how you are going to write your code. It also allows others to be able to understand what you are doing/where you are going with it
## What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
  * it allows us to be able to store/access and delete the data that we need into our "database"
## What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
  * PostGres is a SQL database and MongoDB is a NoSQL database
## What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
  * It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB
## Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
  * The three pieces of data I choose are client, server and database. I love the analogy of restaurants as I have been a chef/cook my whole life. Without the server of any sorts the client can not request info from the database/kitchen.
