# Vocabulary
  * functional programming: set of guiding principles for software development, where more thought is given to the input and output of functions
  * pure function: a function where given the same inputs, it always returns the same outputs and has no side effects on the application environment
  * higher-order function: any function which takes another function as an argument and/or returns a function. They are often used to abstract or isolate actions within an overarching action.
  * immutable state: immutable means to not change, and the state of an application usually refers to all of the data an application is maintaing at a certain point in time.
  * object: can be a variable, data structure, function or method. Also called instances, are a piece of data recorded in memory and accessible by an identifier.
  * object-oriented programming (OOP): set of guiding principles where an application is thought of as a collection of objects interacting with one another
  * class: a blueprint for an object, specifying how that object should be created, what initial data values it has, and what actions can be done upon this object through class methods
  * prototype: blueprint of an object. In JS everything is based on a generic "object" class, which is not directly editable by developers. We can change this by accessing the prototype of any instance
  * super: the Keyword refers to the parent class of the current class you're developing
  * inheritance: process of basing an object or class upon an existing "parent" object or class. Allows the "child" to acquire all the variables and methods specified by the "
  * constructor: a function that defines how an object should be created. JS objects innately inherit from a generic "object" class, we usually don't have to define much in a constructor other than the initial values of any custom variables
  * instance:a single object created based on a class or data type's specifications. Only exist while the application is running
  * context: used to represent the current scope or environment you're operating in
  * this: used to refer to the current context; the current object, class or function you are in
